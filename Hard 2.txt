#Hard 2 
#You are given a string s. You can convert s to a 
#palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
#Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
 
#Example 1:
#Input: s = "aacecaaa"
#Output: "aaacecaaa"

#CODE:

def shortest_palindrome(s):
    if not s:
        return ""

    i = 0
    for j in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            i += 1

    # The remaining portion of the string needs to be reversed and added to the front
    return s[i:][::-1] + s

# Test cases
print(shortest_palindrome("aacecaaa"))  # Output: "aaacecaaa"
print(shortest_palindrome("abcd"))  # Output: "dcbabcd"
